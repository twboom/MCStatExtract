# MCTools
Get other player's stats formatted nicely!

This is a (vanilla) JavaScript webapp that runs 100% client-side.

## How to use
### Using the website
I host this on a website, so you can just access it all of the time! You can find it on this [website].

1. Get your statistics files and upload it with the button at the top.
2. Choose the category of the statistics you want to compare.
3. Type in the name of the statistic. This *has* to be without the `minecraft:` prefix, but *with* the underscores. The name might differ from what you see in Minecraft itself
4. Click the big search button!

### Getting the statistics
To get the statistics, you *have* to have access to the world files.

1. Navigate to your `world` folder.
2. Enter the `stats` folder. The `.json` files are the important files.
3. Copy/Download the files (or directly to step 4).
4. Upload the files (step 1 of using the website).
